# Addressable Network Proposals

This github is for:

- Clarifying and documenting the Prebid Addressability Framework (PAF) project requirements.
- Drafting specification and demonstrable prototypes that answer those
- Delivering an MVP of the necessary components

This repository is intended to share this work with the Prebid community, get feedback and reviews.

## PAF MVP implementation
Another github repo contains the code for the PAF MVP. It can be found here: [PAF MVP implementation](https://github.com/prebid/paf-mvp-implementation)

# Providing feedback

The minimum friction way to provide feedback is to use Github's
[Creating an issue from code](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-code)
feature.

It looks like this:
