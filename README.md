# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

The **Prebid Addressability Framework** (**PAF**) is a community-driven, open-source framework including founding principles, technical protocols, user experience requirements and contractual terms. It is designed to provide users with a consistent, transparent, low-friction experience while navigating across the open web. On marketers and publishers’ side, it makes responsible addressable marketing available for industry actors.

PAF sets up a random Identifier (ID) that is transparent to the User, and that is linked to user marketing preferences which can be changed at any moment and are not owned nor controlled by a single PAF actor. Preferences signal  User’s choice to either see personalized marketing and content (based on their behavior and interests) or standard marketing and content (that aren't linked to their behavior and interests).

## 1.2 Principles

PAF is built on four key principles:

-   **Secure and privacy friendly**: IDs automatically reset without user interaction every 6 months. Users can reset their ID at any time and on any PAF participating site. This ensures data minimization and is compliant with global privacy regulations.
    
-   **User transparency and control**: Users can easily view and manage and change their preferences on any site that uses this data. Users can also inquire on who received their data to show a specific ad, through available Audit Logs.
    
-   **Open-source and interoperable**: The framework is open-source and doesn’t provide any self-preferencing benefit to existing marketplace providers.
    
-   **Independently governed**: PAF actors incorporate the Model Terms into their general terms and ensure their use of data is available in an accountable Audit Log viewable by all actors.
    

These core principles keep user preferences at the center, while ensuring the AdTech industry implements a framework that allows all actors to continue to achieve their business goals seamlessly.

### Network DNS zone

In the current design, PAF Operator have the constraint to run services on subdomains of a common domain name. This is because the synchronization of PAF IDs and Preferences across PAF Operators relies on the cookie jar for the common domain.

To achieve this, each Operator is responsible for inserting the right information for the subdomain that they use in the network’s DNS zone.

For example for the `onekey.network` network, the `operator_a.onekey.network` is mapped to the DNS server of Operator A through a NS/SOA records.


## 4. The Role of the Model Terms

The framework includes a text document containing a set of legal clauses that any pair of organizations may include in the contract that binds them. Those are called “the Model Terms”.

For example:

-   an organization operating a Website may include the Model Terms in its contract with an organization that operates their CMP.
    
-   similarly, it may be included in the contract between a Website and its PAF Operator.
    
-   between a Website and their SSP.
    
-   between a SSP and an Ad Exchange, or between a SSP and a DSP etc.
    

The benefit of using the Model Terms is that it reinforces the compliance of both organizations to Data Protection regulation, and clarifies their respective liabilities in case of harm resulting from misprocessing of the user data.

It’s notable that the Model Terms requires that PAF IDs and Preferences that are sent from one party to another may only be further transferred to third parties with whom a contract including the Model Terms has also been signed.

When an organization decide to use the Model Terms in its contract, it guarantees that the PAF IDs and Preferences that they process and transfer can only be legally processed by other organization that are also bound to the same terms.

The goal of the technical part of the framework, which is further described in this documentation, is to facilitate the conformity of the organization operations to those terms.
