# Addressable Network Proposals

At Criteo Engineering we are working on:

- Clarifying and documenting our understanding of the Prebid Addressability Framework (PAF) project requirements.
- Drafting specification and demonstrable prototypes that answer those
- Delivering an MVP of the necessary components

This repository is intended to share this work with the Prebid community, get feedback and reviews.

[Creating an issue from code](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-code)
