# Adressable Network Proposals

At Criteo Engineering we are working on:

- Clarifying and documenting our understanding of the Prebid SSO project requirements.
- Drafting specification and demonstrable prototypes that answer those
- Delivering a MVP of the necessary components

This repository is intended to share this work with the Prebid SSO community, get feedback and reviews.

# Providing feedback

The minimum friction way to provide feedback is to use Github's
[Creating an issue from code](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-code)
feature.

It looks like this:
