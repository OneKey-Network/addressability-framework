	v. can be configured to provide Users with a link to retrieve the User Interface to view, edit and update their PAF Data, including their Preferences; and

	vi. must display a transient notice that must appear for no less than three seconds, for any User that has chosen to store Preferences, but not interacted with the User Interface of the current website.

10. The User Interface Provider shall ensure that no Party, including the User Interface Provider itself, may alter, amend or delete any text or functionality required under clause 5.9, except that the User Interface Provider shall be permitted to create accurate language translations of any such text where appropriate and to provide additional consent management and preference functionality in respect of activities not required under that clause (by way of example only, age verification), subject always to the restrictions in clause 6. The addition of text to clarify the meaning of any text or functionality required under clause 5.9 is permitted.

11. When a User accesses the User Interface to update their Preferences and/or Raw PAF Data, the User Interface Provider shall share the updated Preferences and/or Raw PAF Data with the PAF Operator with whom it has a Main Agreement.

13. When a User chooses to apply Preferences only to the website it is visiting using the option described at clause 5.9(ii)(e), the User Interface Provider shall not pass any PAF Data or Raw PAF Data to any PAF Operator. A User Interface Provider must not use any PAF Data except in accordance with the documented instructions of the Party that is its Controller (such instructions to comply with these Model Terms), and never for its own purposes.

14. The Contracting Parties acknowledge and agree that a Contracting Party that is a User Interface Provider under the Main Agreement may be a Party that is not a User Interface Provider under another Main Agreement and that Party shall always Process PAF Data in a manner that is consistent with its obligations under these Model Terms for its role.

2. The Contracting Parties shall ensure they allocate their responsibilities as Joint Controllers under Data Protection Laws and document this using appropriate terms in the Main Agreement or a supplementary agreement. These include but are not limited to terms addressing how privacy notices are provided to Users, responding to and fulfilling rights requests under Data Protection Laws and to complaints, registering with Supervisory Authorities as appropriate, implementing security measures and taking steps to apply other key principles under Data Protection Laws, conducting any required risk or other assessments and documenting compliance with Data Protection Laws generally, determining data retention periods, producing and maintaining Processing records, and notifying security incidents to Supervisory Authorities or Users, where these are reportable (collectively, “**Joint** **Controller Obligations**”).

3. Each Contracting Party that is a Sender warrants to the other Party that it has obtained consent to the extent required by both Contracting Parties to comply with Data Protection Laws in connection with the uses of PAF Data contemplated under these Model Terms.

4. Any Contracting Party that is a User Interface Provider for another Party shall be a Processor in relation to its Processing of Personal Data under its Main Agreement with that Party. Accordingly, under its Main Agreement with a PAF Operator (or any other Party), the User Interface Provider shall be deemed to be acting on behalf (and on the documented instructions) of its contracted Controller relevant to the Transaction being Processed by the User Interface Provider.

5. The Standard Processor Clauses shall apply between each User Interface Provider and the Party that is its Controller in accordance with clause 7.4 and shall be deemed incorporated into these Model Terms. Those Standard Processor Clauses shall be deemed populated with the Processor Processing Description.

7. Each Contracting Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against accidental unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration or disclosure of, or access to, the PAF Data (together, “**Security Measures**”) and shall set out or reference a description of all such measures in the Main Agreement.

8. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that it publishes on its website a Privacy Notice relating to its Processing of PAF Data. Where it is the Root Party, the Contracting Party shall at all times provide a mechanism that allows the User to inspect the PAF Audit Log and to access the Privacy Notices of the Parties included in that log.
