	vi. must display a transient notice that must appear for no less than three seconds, for any User that has chosen to store Preferences, but not interacted with the User Interface of the current website.

10. The User Interface Provider shall ensure that no Party, including the User Interface Provider itself, may alter, amend or delete any text or functionality required under clause 5.9, except that the User Interface Provider shall be permitted to create accurate language translations of any such text where appropriate and to provide additional consent management and preference functionality in respect of activities not required under that clause (by way of example only, age verification), subject always to the restrictions in clause 6. The addition of text to clarify the meaning of any text or functionality required under clause 5.9 is permitted.

11. When a User accesses the User Interface to update their Preferences and/or Raw PAF Data, the User Interface Provider shall share the updated Preferences and/or Raw PAF Data with the PAF Operator with whom it has a Main Agreement.

5. The Standard Processor Clauses shall apply between each User Interface Provider and the Party that is its Controller in accordance with clause 7.4 and shall be deemed incorporated into these Model Terms. Those Standard Processor Clauses shall be deemed populated with the Processor Processing Description.

7. Each Contracting Party shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against accidental unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration or disclosure of, or access to, the PAF Data (together, “**Security Measures**”) and shall set out or reference a description of all such measures in the Main Agreement.

8. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that it publishes on its website a Privacy Notice relating to its Processing of PAF Data. Where it is the Root Party, the Contracting Party shall at all times provide a mechanism that allows the User to inspect the PAF Audit Log and to access the Privacy Notices of the Parties included in that log.
