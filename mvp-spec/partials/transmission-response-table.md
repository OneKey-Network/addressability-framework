| version         | Number                        | The version of the PAF used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| transaction_id  | String                        | A GUID dedicated to the Addressable Content. It allows associating the Transmission Responses to Transmission Request                                                                                                                     |
| receiver        | String                        | The domain name of the DSP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| status          | String                        | Equals "success" if the DSP signed the Transmission and returns it to the sender.<br /> Equals "error_bad_request" if the receiver doesn't understand or see inconsistency in the Transmission Request.<br /> Equals "error_cannot_process" if the receiver cannot handle the Transmission Request properly. |
| details         | String                        | In case of an error status, the DSP can provide details concerning the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| children        | Array of Transmission Results | An empty array as we consider that the DSP doesn't share the PAF Data to its suppliers via new transmissions.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| source          | Source object                 | The source contains all the data for identifying the DSP and verifying the Transmission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
