# Operator Design

‚ö†Ô∏è **Diagrams** in this page use the [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) language.
We plan to install GitHub actions to automatically generate images from the diagrams, but until then,
you are invited to install a browser extension such as [mermaid-diagrams](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mermaid-diagrams/phfcghedmopjadpojhmmaffjmfiakfil) to visualise them.
You might need to **refresh the page** to get the rendered image.

## Protocol

The proposed solution enforces the usage of TLS (HTTPS) for all communication to and from the operator, to prevent middle men to "spy" on data that is passed.

- data is **transfered in a human readable fashion**, even when transported as part of the query string ("redirect" scenario without 3PC). Note that when using HTTPS, query string parameters are encrypted.

- data is **stored in a human readable fashion** as cookies

- **signatures** are used to secure communications, but **not encryption**:

    - when **sending** a request or a response, the sender:

        - provides a **timestamp** and its own domain (the **domain name of the *sender***) are part of the payload

        - signs the whole **payload + the domain name of the *receiver*** (which is not part of the payload), using its **own private key**

    - when **receiving** a request or a response, the receiver:

        - recalls the **public key of the sender** based on the domain name that was provided as part of the payload (this can be done via a cache + regular calls to `/identity` endpoint, similar to what is done in SWAN)

        - **verifies** the provided **signature**, based on (the complete payload + its own domain name), using the sender's public key

            - ‚ÑπÔ∏è verifying the signature is the way to authenticate the sender

        - (in the case of the operator) verifies the **permissions** associated with this domain name

        - verify the provided **timestamp** is in an acceptable time frame

The designed solution is a protocol:

‚úÖ reduces the server to server (S2S) calls to a minimum, making nodes more reliable.

‚úÖ is transparent to users and regulators (cookies and requests are human readable).

‚úÖ data received from the operator as a full page redirect can be processed by a web server **or in the browser**, in Javascript, because no decryption is needed.

‚úÖ protects from hackers' attempts:

- to read or write Prebid SSO data without being authenticated and authorized.

- to replay legit requests to the operator in an attempt to read or write Prebid SSO data or to websites to overwrite cookies on their domains (because of timestamp + signature).

- to replay legit URLs to overwrite cookies on *other* websites' domain (because the signature includes the receiver's domain name, it is tight to a specific receiver).

Limitations:

üü† operator needs to keep track of (potentially numerous) clients' public keys for signature verification

üü† data remains visible (or can be made visible) in URLs, so it can be used by web browser as part of the browsing history.

üü† it can also appear in web server logs.
