# Operator Design

## Protocol

The designed solution is a protocol:

‚úÖ reduces the server to server (S2S) calls to a minimum, making nodes more reliable.

‚úÖ is easier to debug (cookies and requests are human-readable).

‚úÖ data received from the operator as a full page redirect can be processed by a web server **or in the browser**, in Javascript, because no decryption is needed.

‚úÖ protects from hackers' attempts:

- to read or write Prebid SSO data without being authenticated and authorized.

- to replay legit requests to the operator in an attempt to read or write Prebid SSO data or to websites to overwrite cookies on their domains (because of timestamp + signature).

- to replay legit URLs to overwrite cookies on *other* websites' domain (because the signature includes the receiver's domain name, it is tight to a specific receiver).

Limitations:

üü† operator needs to keep track of (potentially numerous) clients' public keys for signature verification

üü† data remains visible (or can be made visible) in URLs, so it can be used by web browser as part of the browsing history.

üü† it can also appear in web server logs.
