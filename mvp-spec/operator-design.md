# Operator Design

## Protocol

The proposed solution enforces the usage of TLS (HTTPS) for all communication to and from the operator, to prevent middle men to "spy" on data that is passed.

- data is transferred in a **text format** which facilitates inspection and troubleshooting by web developers, even when transported as part of the query string ("redirect" scenario without 3PC).

- it is also **stored** as cookies in a **text format** which end users can inspect

- **signatures** are used to secure communications, but **not encryption**:

    - when **sending** a request or a response, the sender:

        - provides a **timestamp** and its own domain (the **domain name of the *sender***) are part of the payload

        - signs the whole **payload + the domain name of the *receiver*** (which is not part of the payload), using its **own private key**

    - when **receiving** a request or a response, the receiver:

        - recalls the **public key of the sender** based on the domain name that was provided as part of the payload (this can be done via a cache + regular calls to `/identity` endpoint, similar to what is done in SWAN)

        - **verifies** the provided **signature**, based on (the complete payload + its own domain name), using the sender's public key

            - ‚ÑπÔ∏è verifying the signature is the way to authenticate the sender

        - (in the case of the operator) verifies the **permissions** associated with this domain name

        - verify the provided **timestamp** is in an acceptable time frame

The designed solution is a protocol:

‚úÖ reduces the server to server (S2S) calls to a minimum, making nodes more reliable.

‚úÖ is easier to debug (cookies and requests are in plain text).

‚úÖ data received from the operator as a full page redirect can be processed by a web server **or in the browser**, in Javascript, because no decryption is needed.

‚úÖ protects from hackers' attempts:

- to read or write Prebid Addressability Framework data without being authenticated and authorized.

- to replay legit requests to the operator in an attempt to read or write Prebid Addressability Framework data or to websites to overwrite cookies on their domains (because of timestamp + signature).

- to replay legit URLs to overwrite cookies on *other* websites' domain (because the signature includes the receiver's domain name, it is tight to a specific receiver).

Limitations:

üü† operator needs to keep track of (potentially numerous) clients' public keys for signature verification

üü† data remains visible (or can be made visible) in URLs, so it can be used by web browser as part of the browsing history.

üü† it can also appear in web server logs.


## Write Scenario: the user visits a Publisher for the first time

A user visits a Publisher and sets their preferences for the first time.

In this case, the Publisher, the CMP and the Operator interact via 
redirection mechanisms to collect the Pseudonymous-Identifier and the Preferences
of the user and *write* it in a secure way. Therefore, this scenario is
called the **"WRITE" scenario**.

## Read Scenario: The user visits an Advertiser for the first time

After visiting a Publisher and generating their User Id and Preferences, the user
goes to an Advertiser website. 

In this case, the Advertiser website wants to *read* the User Id and Preferences of the 
user. Therefore, this scenario is named the **"READ" scenario**.
