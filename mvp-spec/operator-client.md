# Operator client

## Operator client: frontend, proxy and backend

An operator client is an actor that needs to interact with a PAF operator, to either:

- read user ids and preferences
- write user preferences
- or both

Ids and preferences are stored as **1st party cookies on the PAF top level +1 domain** (aka TLD+1).

Operator clients are **websites** that need to get access to this data. As a reminder, the content of these websites
is _served by a http server_ and it can then use Javascript _in the browser_.

- PAF provides a "**frontend operator client**" in the form of a Javascript library, to call the operator on REST or "
  redirect" endpoints (see [operator-api.md](operator-api.md) for details).
    - But only **signed** requests can be sent to the operator and these requests are signed using a **private key**,
      which must never be sent to the browser.

- Thus, PAF also provides a "**backend operator proxy**" which the frontend operator client uses to sign the requests on
  its behalf.
    - this proxy can be hosted by the website's owner or by a tech vendor

- Finally, clients of the PAF operators can use an optional "**backend operator client**" that will sign requests and
  redirect to the operator if needed.
    - this is part of the website's http server
    - this can be interesting to trigger HTTP redirects before any web page is served

## Backend operator proxy

The "backend operator **proxy**", owned by any operator client (publisher, advertiser) and hosted by them or by a tech
vendor, is an API called by the frontend operator client to sign and verify requests sent and received to / from the
operator.

As the name suggests, it is a proxy that transforms unsigned requests into signed ones.

To do so, it exposes:

- all [the (REST and redirect) endpoints that the **operator** exposes](operator-api.md), except "Verify 3PC support"
  and "Get identity"
- a couple of extra endpoints to help sign and verify messages

## Frontend operator client

The integration of an operator client happens

## How to implement an operator client

- [The implementation project](https://github.com/criteo/paf-mvp-demo-express/tree/main/paf-mvp-frontend)
  provides documentation to use the **frontend operator client** Javascript library.
- It also provides example implementations (NodeJS) of
  a [backend operator proxy and backend operator client](https://github.com/criteo/paf-mvp-demo-express/tree/main/paf-mvp-operator-client-express)
  .

## Implementation details

<details>
<summary>Read ids and preferences</summary>

The following diagram details the steps needed to read existing cookies from PAF

- at server level, _if the website decides to use a **backend operator client**_, HTTP redirects can be triggered when
  needed
- at browser level the **frontend operator client** (a Javascript library) is used
    - depending on the context, the JS library calls a REST or "redirect" endpoint on the operator
    - it relies on the **backend operator proxy**, a component responsible for building operator URLs to call.

### Test support of 3rd party cookies

To test if third party cookies are supported and trigger redirect otherwise, the following logic is used:

1. if a backend client is used, then
    - based on user agent, if the browser is known to **not** support 3PC (ex: Safari) ‚û°Ô∏è consider no 3PC and
      immediately **HTTP redirect**
2. in Javascript,
    - based on user agent, if the browser is known to **not** support 3PC (ex: Safari) ‚û°Ô∏è consider no 3PC and
      immediately **javascript redirect**
3. otherwise, attempt to call REST endpoint and read existing (3PC) Prebid ID
    - at the same time, the operator attempts to write a "test" cookie on .prebidsso.com (ie. attempt to write a 3PC)
4. if Prebid ID is retrieved, of course it means 3PC **are** supported
5. if no Prebid ID retrieved, it means either that the user is not known, or that 3PC are not supported
    - call operator to attempt to read "test" cookie that was just written
    - if success ‚û°Ô∏è 3PC **are** supported, it's just that the user is not known
    - if failure ‚û°Ô∏è 3PC are **not** supported, **javascript redirect**

### Actual cookies writing

Note: cookies set by Javascript can be read by the http server when it receives a successive call, and vice-versa.

In other words, after a redirect by the operator back to the website,

- when using a **backend operator client**:
    - the backend operator client will set 1st party cookies (either a value or "unknown")
    - these cookies will be visible by the JS
    - so in the JS part of the diagram below, the answer to the question "Any Prebid 1st party üç™?" is: **yes** and the
      cookies won't be written twice
- when not using a backend operator client, these cookies will be written by JS
