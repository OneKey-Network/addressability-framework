# Response code

The response code used on a redirect endpoint<br>While REST endpoints can use HTTP codes to communicate the state of the response, redirect endpoints are limited to `30x` HTTP codes.<br>To address this problem, this property is used to contain the same HTTP code as the one that would be returned by a REST endpoint.

**Examples:** 

```json
"200"
```

```json
"400"
```

```json
"503"
```
