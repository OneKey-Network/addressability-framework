# Transmission Status

Equals "success" if the DSP signed the Transmission and returns it to the sender.<br /> Equals "error_bad_request" if the receiver doesn't understand or see inconsistency in the Transmission Request.<br /> Equals "error_cannot_process" if the receiver failed to use the data of the Transmission Request properly.

Can only take **one of these values**:
* `"success"`
* `"error_bad_request"`
* `"error_cannot_process"`
