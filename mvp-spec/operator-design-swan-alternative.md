# SWAN

Although not implementing the exact endpoints described above, [SWAN]([swan/apis.md at main ¬∑ SWAN-community/swan ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan/blob/main/apis.md)) provides a solution that can be used for all workflows.

Some core principles of SWAN are:

- all data is **encrypted and decrypted by the operator** (using its private key) before to be sent over the network

- clients need to do a server to server call to the access node **before each communication**
  
  - the client is authenticated via its "API key" during this preliminary handshake

- the "**access node**" is a particular node in the operator network, responsible for handling encryption and decryption for clients

- messages are using a **proprietary binary format** for transport and cookie storage, for optimization

- it is originally made to support a tree of operator nodes, under a different domain, although the solution works with a single TLD+1 domain.

The SWAN solution is very modular, based on different open source projects (OWID, SWIFT) and meant to be generic (not limited to the Prebid SSO use case).

‚úÖ the level of security is high because all data is encrypted

‚úÖ robust solution with existing implementations and demo

Limitations:

üü† to support a wide variety of use cases, it has a complicated code and workflow and unnecessary S2S calls and redirects

- calls to encrypt and decrypt are systematic, even when encryption is unactivated

- scrambling of cookie paths

- the whole system is meant to support multiple nodes (notion of home node, handling of data collision, etc) which makes it overcomplicated for the single node use case

üü† mandatory backend client

üü† obscure to web users and regulators

üü† complex integration and debug

‚ÑπÔ∏è the diagram below is based on the SWAN demo, where CMP is considered to be a dedicated web site that the user is redirected to, not an integrated widget. This counts for a few extra redirects that could probably be avoided.
