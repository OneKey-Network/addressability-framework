# Operator API proposal

## Context

Operators are contracting parties responsible for storing and controlling access to users data, in a secured way.

In this context,

- **data** means:
  - **Prebid ID** is the pseudonymous identifier _generated by an operator_ to identify a device
    - Other optional IDs will be supported in the future but are **not** part of the MVP
  - **Preferences** are user-set preferences regarding online tracking that is _captured by a CMP UI_ or a website (
    such as a publisher).
    - In the MVP, only one "preference" is supported: optin status.
- **storing** means in the form of **cookies** stored on Prebid SSO top level domain +1 (TLD+1, ex: `prebidsso.com`)
- **controlling access** means to offer ways for contracting parties to read and write this data and help them store a
  copy ("cache") of these cookies on their own domain.
- ***in a secured way*** has different meanings that are discussed below

Multiple operators will implement the same set of core features under the same TLD+1, although at this stage it is not
clear how they will co-operate.

## Example workflows

We represent two typical workflows:

- the first interaction with Prebid where a user visits a publisher's page, that triggers a CMP
- a visit to a advertiser while the user already opted in to Prebid

...in two different contexts:

- where the browser supports third party cookies (3PC)
- where it doesn't

### With 3PC

When 3d party cookies are available, all calls to read cookies can be made via Javascript to read or write data.

- When visiting a publisher and meeting Prebid SSO for the first time:
  - the publisher's page is called.
  - the publisher's backend serves the requested page, and it includes a JS library that checks for existence of
    Prebid SSO cookie
  - a JS call to the operator to "read or init" data will generate a new ID
  - the ID can be displayed in the CMP UI
  - when the user submits their preferences:
    - a JS call is made to the CMP to "prepare" the values to write (more about this, below)
    - another JS call is made to the operator to write these values (saved under Prebid SSO domain)
    - finally, these values are saved on the publisher's domain
- When a participating user visits an advertiser:
  - a JS call is made to the operator to get the Prebid SSO ID and preferences
  - the values are saved on the advertiser's domain

‚ÑπÔ∏è in this scenario, no full page redirect is needed

### Without 3PC

Without 3d party cookies,

- **a full page load** on Prebid SSO domain is needed to read or write cookies stored on Prebid SSO TLD+1
- **a full page load** on the website domain is needed to write cookies based on values read from Prebid SSO

So the only way to interact with Prebid SSO cookies is through  **full page "redirects"**.

- When visiting a publisher and meeting Prebid SSO for the first time:
  - the publisher's page is called. Here,  **two options are possible**:
    - either the publisher's _backend_ checks the existence of Prebid SSO cookie, and redirect the user to Prebid
      SSO operator
    - or, the publisher's backend serves the requested page, and it includes a JS library that does exactly the same
      thing
  - in both cases the browser is  **redirected**  to Prebid SSO operator to read any existing cookie or to create an
    ID if needed
  - the operator  **redirects**  back to the original page, this time with a Prebid SSO ID as part of the URL
  - the CMP is displayed
  - the ID can be displayed in the CMP UI if needed
  - when the user submits their preferences:
    - a JS call is made to the CMP to "prepare" the values to write
    - via JS, a  **redirect**  is triggered to the operator to write these values (saved under Prebid SSO domain)
    - the operator  **redirects**  back to the original page, this time with a Prebid SSO ID & preferences as part
      of the URL
    - finally, these values are saved as cookies on the publisher's domain
      - Note that this, again, can be done on the publisher's backend side or via JS
- When a participating user visits an advertiser:
  - on the advertiser backend, a  **redirect**  is triggered to the operator to get the Prebid SSO ID and preferences
  - the operator  **redirects**  back to the original page, this time with a Prebid SSO ID & preferences as part of
    the URL
  - the values are saved on the advertiser's domain

## Endpoints

To support the previous workflows (and more), a few endpoints are needed on the operator API.

These endpoints need to support both the "3PC" and "no 3PC" contexts.

- where 3PC are available, a simple JS call is optimum
  - in this case, we favour POST calls when data is mutated (data mutation == when  **a cookie is created or updated
    on Prebid SSO TLD+1 domain**)
  - return code is HTTP 200 and return type is JSON
- where 3PC are not available, a full page redirect is required to read or write cookies on Prebid SSO TLD+1 domain
  - in this context, POST is not possible
  - return code is 302 with no content: data is part of the redirect URL

In practice, this will translate into endpoints available under different root paths. Example paths are specified in the last column of the table.

## Messages

`@TODO` Message formats to be detailed. The exact message format (JSON or not, `source` property, `version` property etc) is directly linked to what is discussed in DSP API. Should probably be handled in a dedicated document.

## Design

### SWAN

Although not implementing the exact endpoints described above, [SWAN]([swan/apis.md at main ¬∑ SWAN-community/swan ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/SWAN-community/swan/blob/main/apis.md)) provides a solution that can be used for all workflows.



Some core principles of SWAN are:

- all data is **encrypted and decrypted by the operator** (using its private key) before to be sent over the network

- clients need to do a server to server call to the access node **before each communication**
  
  - the client is authenticated via its "API key" during this preliminary handshake

- the "**access node**" is a particular node in the operator network, responsible for handling encryption and decryption for clients

- messages are using a **proprietary binary format** for transport and cookie storage, for optimization

- it is originally made to support a tree of operator nodes, under a different domain, although the solution works with a single TLD+1 domain.



The SWAN solution is very modular, based on different open source projects (OWID, SWIFT) and meant to be generic (not limited to the Prebid SSO use case).



‚úÖ the level of security is high because all data is encrypted

‚úÖ robust solution with existing implementations and demo



Limitations:

üü† to support a wide variety of use cases, it has a complicated code and workflow and unnecessary S2S calls and redirects

- calls to encrypt and decrypt are systematic, even when encryption is unactivated

- scrambling of cookie paths

- the whole system is meant to support multiple nodes (notion of home node, handling of data collision, etc) which makes it overcomplicated for the single node use case

üü† mandatory backend client

üü† obscure to web users and regulators

üü† complex integration and debug



‚ÑπÔ∏è the diagram below is based on the SWAN demo, where CMP is considered to be a dedicated web site that the user is redirected to, not an integrated widget. This counts for a few extra redirects that could probably be avoided.

### Proposed protocol

The proposed solution enforces the usage of TLS (HTTPS) for all communication to and from the operator, to prevent middle men to "spy" on data that is passed.

- data is **transfered in a human readable fashion**, even when transported as part of the query string ("redirect" scenario without 3PC). Note that when using HTTPS, query string parameters are encrypted.

- data is **stored in a human readable fashion** as cookies

- **signatures** are used to secure communications, but **not encryption**:
  
  - when **sending** a request or a response, the sender:
    
    - provides a **timestamp** and its own domain (the **domain name of the *sender***) are part of the payload
    
    - signs the whole **payload + the domain name of the *receiver*** (which is not part of the payload), using its **own private key**
  
  - when **receiving** a request or a response, the receiver:
    
    - recalls the **public key of the sender** based on the domain name that was provided as part of the payload (this can be done via a cache + regular calls to `/identity` endpoint, similar to what is done in SWAN)
    
    - **verifies** the provided **signature**, based on (the complete payload + its own domain name), using the sender's public key
      
      - ‚ÑπÔ∏è verifying the signature is the way to authenticate the sender
    
    - (in the case of the operator) verifies the **permissions** associated with this domain name
    
    - verify the provided **timestamp** is in an acceptable time frame

This protocol:

‚úÖ reduces the server to server (S2S) calls to a minimum, making nodes more reliable.

‚úÖ is transparent to users and regulators (cookies and requests are human readable).

‚úÖ data received from the operator as a full page redirect can be processed by a web server **or in the browser**, in Javascript, because no decryption is needed.

‚úÖ protects from hackers' attempts:

- to read or write Prebid SSO data without being authenticated and authorized.

- to replay legit requests to the operator in an attempt to read or write Prebid SSO data or to websites to overwrite cookies on their domains (because of timestamp + signature).

- to replay legit URLs to overwrite cookies on *other* websites' domain (because the signature includes the receiver's domain name, it is tight to a specific receiver).

Limitations:

üü† data remains visible in URLs, so it can be used by web browser as part of the browsing history.

üü† it can also appear in web server logs.
